# 🚗 Car Rental Management System (Full-Stack App)

This is a full-stack Car Rental Management System currently in development. It is designed to simulate a real-world car booking platform with distinct admin and customer workflows. The project showcases integration between modern frontend and secure backend frameworks, ideal for learning and demonstrating full-stack development with Java and Angular.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3, Spring Security 6, Java 17, REST APIs
- **Frontend:** Angular 16, Ng Zorro UI
- **Database:** MySQL (Relational DB)
- **Other:** Maven, Git, Postman
